Web-Based Loop Pedal Instrument Spec (Boss-Style)

Overview

We will implement a web-based loop pedal instrument that mimics the behavior of a Boss loop pedal, with keyboard inputs acting as footswitches. The instrument will support loop recording, playback, overdubbing, pausing, stopping, and undo/redo operations. The interface will include a keyboard-based drum machine and chord/harmony control inspired by physical loop pedal workflows.

Keyboard Mappings

Spacebar: Primary switch (Record/Play/Overdub cycle)

Shift + Spacebar: Stop/Start All Loops

Backspace: Undo Last Overdub

Ctrl + Backspace: Redo Last Overdub

Enter: Clear All Loops

Arrow Up: Increase Tempo

Arrow Down: Decrease Tempo

1-5: Select Track (for multi-track mode)

M: Mute/Unmute All Tracks

T: Tap Tempo

Loop Pedal States

The system will follow the standard Boss loop pedal state machine:

Idle: No loops recorded.

Recording: Recording the initial loop.

Playing: Loop is playing back.

Overdubbing: Recording layers over the initial loop.

Cycle:

Idle -> Recording: Spacebar press.

Recording -> Playing: Spacebar press.

Playing -> Overdubbing: Spacebar press.

Overdubbing -> Playing: Spacebar press.

Track Management

Single Track Mode: One loop at a time.

Multi-Track Mode: Up to 5 tracks.

Tracks can be individually muted, stopped, or soloed using keys 1 to 5.

Recording Logic

First recording sets the loop length.

Subsequent overdubs must align with the original loop length.

Playback Logic

Loops are quantized to start on the next measure.

Playback can be stopped and resumed seamlessly.

Drum Machine Integration

ASDF keys: Trigger drum sounds.

QWER keys: Trigger chords/harmonies.

Visual Feedback

Display waveform for each track.

Show loop length and tempo.

Use color changes to indicate recording (red), playing (green), and overdubbing (yellow).

Advanced Features

Tap Tempo: Press T repeatedly to set BPM.

Undo/Redo: Supports undo/redo of overdubs.

Pause: Press M to mute all loops without resetting playback position.

This spec replicates the functionality of a Boss loop pedal while taking advantage of the keyboard interface for efficient control of loops, drums, and harmonies.
