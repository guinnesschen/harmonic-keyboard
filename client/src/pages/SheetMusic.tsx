<h2>Easy Difficulty: Good Luck Babe by Chappell Roan</h2>


             V            B
It's fine, it's cool
   Z                                               N
You can say that we are nothing, but you know the truth
                        V          B
And guess I'm the fool
          Z                                              N
With her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof

                                                        X     
I don't wanna call it off

But you don't wanna call it love
                                        X                                
You only wanna be the one that I call "baby"

                                                     V                                  B
You can kiss a hundred boys in bars

Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling

You can say it's just the way you are

Yesterday
        					CE                           N             B  V
All my troubles seemed so far away
B                                   Z   
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
         M1  N       XQ    V        Z     
Oh, I believe in yesterday

    Z              M
Suddenly

I'm not half the man I used to be
         B                       Z
There's a shadow hanging over me
M1 N       XQ            V        Z
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

  					    M    CE   N    B  V 
Why she had to go
                B               BE             Z
I don't know, she wouldn't say
 				          M CE  N     B        V 
I said something wrong
           B          BE       Z
Now I long for yesterday
